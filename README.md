**Currently in Development, might not be very stable, and features are incomplete**

The goal of RsemanticLibrarian is to provide R functions to use the Semantic Librarian for document search, as a function of semantic similarity. Currently, the semantic librarian is implemented as an R Shiny app [https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/SemanticLibrarian](https://crumplab.shinyapps.io/SemanticLibrarian). This package will allow similar operations to be run in R, without the Shiny App. Additionally, the goal is to add additional functions to build your own corpus, and run your own version of Semantic Librarian, using a custom corpus.

## Installation

You can install the current version of RsemanticLibrarian this way:

``` r
devtools::install_github("CrumpLab/RsemanticLibrarian")
```

## Example

See the vignette in articles for example usage.
